# quiz-with-timer

## This quiz is made to present the powerful functionalies of javascript.
It is a basic multiple choice quiz that follows the GIVEN,WHEN,THEN format.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

This project was a presser for me learning Javascript. It forced me to learn new concepts in a short period of time.
Bits of this project is pseudocoded to explain each functionality.

The quiz keeps score based on the time left in the quiz deducting seconds and points at the same time.

Mastered Pseudeocode. Without it this would be a mess.
